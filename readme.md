# 2 Setup

## 2.1 Setup for Maya
Just drop the file *maya_drop_installer.py* into the viewport of a running Maya instance. You will be presented with a summary of the installation process. If you have an own userSetup.py working the installer will ask if you want to replace it with the userSetup for cg3. If a replacement is not desired it's recommended to backup your version, let the installer write it's version and merge the two files manually. If your userSetup.py was created by an old version of cg3 and you did not edit the userSetup.py you can safely replace the userSetup.py.
